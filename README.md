# Time to explore Wordpress, the popular website-builder.  
Many people who don't know a thing about coding profit from the fact they can still set-up their own website.
They use the User-side for this, as Im I today.

In short, the goal is to get a 2-paged site online in one day by signing-up in Wordpress,
choosing a template and making some adaptations.

## Steps

- [x] Go to the Wordpress official website and register
- [x] Click on the "start your website" button
- [x] Choose a domain name for your website, then select the free option =  The Crispy Croissant
Don't worry, you don't have to pay. Click the obscurely hidden "start with a free site" link.
### Let's start building!
- [X] Choose a theme if you want to do this on easy mode, use a blank canvas if you want more of a challenge!
Some themes will have a blog-like homepage. The content on this page will be generated based on which posts you make.
This makes it pretty limited as to how we're able to customise our homepage
This will also change some features in your UI, like the "edit" feature on your homepage.
- [x] You will be able to make changes to your homepage, but way more limited than on "regular" pages.
- [x] If you want to change your theme to a different one, click on "My Home" in the menu and next "Change theme"
- [x] There's a couple steps Wordpress gives you in the "Site setup" menu, complete them.
  Pay attention to their explanations, their tutorials help you understand how to interact with their UI
  If you want to skip all tutorials, that's fine too, it should be manageable to understand.
  If you skip the tutorials and things are not clear, you might want to revisit the tutorials.
    * Use templates to get started
    * Use a few of the wordpress features 
    * Add blocks to your website
- [x] When done following the steps, you can launch your website.
  Again, you don't need to pay. Scroll to the bottom of the page for your free option.
  While choosing the plan, you also do not need to pay.
- [x] Now make a repository, add a README and put the link to your website in there.
- [x] Let's have a look at our pages, click on the "Pages" tab in the menu
  You now get an overview of your Published, Drafted, Scheduled and Trashed pages.
  Remove all unwanted pages, only regular pages can be trashed, so make the ones you want to trash all regular pages.
  Add at least one page, you can choose a theme again or use a blank page!
  This takes you to the page editor of Wordpress
  Save this draft for now
- [x] A couple things to know about this edit view:
  If you want to go back to the home view, the top right wordpress logo is the place to go. Click "view pages" and you're back where you were.
  You can click on any element in the page and edit it directly.
    * Make visual adaptations to a wordpress website: changed background color. Deleted blocks and buttons.
  The plus button in the toolbar opens up the block inserter, this is to add new elements to your page.
  If you want a nice overview of all elements on your page, click on the list view in the toolbar
  To the right of the toolbar, you can open up the settings. These show you the settings of the page you're on or the block you select.
  Next to the settings you can change the fonts and global styles
    * Changed fonts.
  The button with the 3 dots is the option button. Right now you can see we are in the visual editor, but if you want to write code you can also open the code editor.
- [x] Let's add some things! Open up the block inserter
  You can see a lot of categories, each containing elements you can add to your page
  From each category, pick at least 1 of the blocks to add to this page, or any other page you make. (Except for the earn category)
  If you can't find one in the category that does not require a premium account, skip the category.
  Make sure to customise every block, you can use dummy / fake text but don't leave anything empty that shouldn't be.
   * Add a Wordpress contact form
   * Add link in button to go to gallery-page
